This solution pattern showcases an architecture which is scalable and efficient system capturing and responding to streaming data using Kafka as the streaming platform and AIML. With Event-Driven Architecture this system can connect to, and consume from a number of systems, services and data sources by responding to triggering events.

This architecture demonstrates how an Event-Driven Architecture with Red Hat AMQ Streams and OpenShift Serverless can help build an intelligent system with OpenShift Data Science platform to drive business insights and drive an event-driven workflow.

Common use cases that can be address with this architecture are:

* Machine Learning and Real-Time Analytics to build business intelligence
* Fraud Detection in financial institutions
* Personalized Recommendations
* Forecasting demand
* Image and Video Analysis for object detection, monitoring, face recognition
* Sentiment analysis

This solution pattern extends Globex a fictitious retail store which has undergone modernization journey and has already adopted Kafka as a streaming platform. Globex wants to now extend their eCommerce website to allow customers to leave their reviews of the product catalogue.

Globex would like to

* Moderate the language comments to ensure foul language is appropriately filtered out
* Build a Sentiment Analysis system to gain business intelligence based on the product reviews
